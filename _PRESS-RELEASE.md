There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.

  Fantasy Football Draft Simulator

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.

  Quickly and easily participate in a fantasy football draft with your friends, or practice your drafting skills in our mock draft simulator.

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.

  Our app provides a quick and easy way to set up your draft room and get your league up and running in minutes.  We provide a simple interface that allows users to queue up and draft players, as well as quickly see players who have already been drafted by other teams.  Our app allows for users to do an official draft with their league mates, as well as participate in mock drafts in order to practice for the real thing.

## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.

  Most fantasy football drafting applications are overly bloated. This product gives users a simple interface which can be set up very quickly.  Additionally, this app gives league commissioners additional control over the draft, and allows commissioners to pause the draft and change drafted players. 

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.

  This will be a single page app which shows a grid of all drafted players, sorted by team and by round.  The interface will include a simple list and simple queue, with limited details to keep interface thin. 

## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.

  This app makes it simple for fantasy football players to get involved in drafts or quickly participate in mock drafts.  Our simple interface will appeal to players who want to participate in a quick mock draft or easily get their league draft started.

## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.

  Making a fantasy football draft as simple as visiting our page and providing a room key.  No login or signup required. 

## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.

  Other fantasy football sites take too long to load and crash often. This just works.

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.
